# Hello

## Added Public-private.py 

#### Public variables 

Can be accessed by objects outside the class 

- Eg. 'object.public_variable' is possible
- public variables are defined normally.

#### Private variables

Cannot be accessed outside class

- Private variables are defined as __privatevariable
- Eg. 'object.__privatevariable' is not possible returns NameError
